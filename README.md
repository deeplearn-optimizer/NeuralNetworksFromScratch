# Neural Networks From Scratch

Here, I have created neural network from scratch using just numpy (no auto differentiation)
Notebook contains all code to make and train a neural network with few layers from scratch and also to train on train_data.mat which contains the Mnist dataset in compressed format..
was able to achieve 98.99 percent accuracy and if we increse few more layers, then the same network can be used to train on some complex face recognition datasets.

# Thank you!
